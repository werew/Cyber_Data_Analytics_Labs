Deadline Second Lab Assignment 3 Jun 2018, 23:59

Learning objectives/outcomes this week

After completion, you will be able to:

    Learn sequential models from time series
    Measure their predictive accuracy
    Discretize time series data

Learning Activities (to do's) this week

    Peer review assigned papers for lab 1
    Read ARMA online tutorial
    Read BATADAL paper by Taormina et al.
    Explore the BATADAL SCADA data set by visualizing the data, learning different predictive models, modifying their parameters, evaluating their performance
    Discretize the sensor data using methods from class (Percentile, SAX, change point detection, ...), and visualize the outcome
    This is a part of the second lab assignment, there is no deliverable this week

Required reading material (other papers are optional)

    Markov chain fingerprinting to classify encrypted traffic
    Scaling up dynamic time warping for datamining applications
    An ARMA tutorial https://machinelearningmastery.com/arima-for-time-series-forecasting-with-python/
    Wikipedia on N-grams https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram

A good intro to modelling using ARMA is https://machinelearningmastery.com/arima-for-time-series-forecasting-with-python/ or https://bicorner.com/2015/11/16/time-series-analysis-using-ipython/or there exist many other good tutorials online.
